# Spotifyapp

Spotify Song Suggester: App designed to predict song choices for users based on similarity of previous song choices.

☝️ Proposal - What problem does our app solve?

The song suggester we’re building will allow users to find new songs based on what they’ve already listened to and liked. We’re using a neural net to predict several different features in order to recommend songs similar to those already enjoyed by the user.

💡 Our Mission Statement

 Our mission is to help you find your next favorite song and/or artist.
