Spotify Song Suggester: App designed to predict song choices for users based on similarity of previous song choices.


This app was a collaboration effort with Joshua Elamin, Nicole Reinke, Michael Carrier, and Andrew Haney.


☝️ Proposal - What problem does our app solve?

The song suggester we’re building will allow users to find new songs based on what they’ve already listened to and liked. We’re using a neural net to predict several different features in order to recommend songs similar to those already enjoyed by the user.
